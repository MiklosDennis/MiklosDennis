### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains a list of Online Courses that I have participated in the past. Each folder will contain a README.md which outlines the steps required to run the code.

I'm currently learning the following in order:
  - Introduction to JavaScript (Codecademy: 10/30hrs completed) 
  - Front-End Engineer (Codeacademy: 0/350 hrs)
  - Back-End Engineer (Codeacademy: 4 months)
  - Optional: Full-Stack Engineer (Codeacademy: 6 Months) 

Completed Online Courses:
  - Machine Learning at Stanford University (Coursera: ~4 Months)
  - Ethereum & Solidity by Stephen Grider (Udemy: ~25 hrs)
  -

Why I'm focusing on the above online courses?
 
A little background info to start, I'm currently enrolled in Aerospace Engineer and entering my fourth year of University. This past year I had the oppurtunity to do an internship at Bombardier as an Aircraft Performance Engineer for 16 months. This internship taught me a lot of valuable fundamentals in Aircraft Performance that I can apply to further jobs in the Aerospace Industry. However, this internship also introduced me to a passion of coding and the field of software engineering since my job focused on a lot of Data Analysis. 

I had strong fundementals of coding in a few languages such as (C, C#, MATLAB and Python) going into this job but never had a chance to apply them. My internship allowed me to apply my knowledge and solve a few challenges which I haven't delt with before. I mainly used Fortran (10%), MATLAB(60%) & Python(30%) to tackle different projects. A key trait I learned was browsing through MATLAB documentation (funny right?) and learning new syntax and commands to make my life easier. Going through documentation of programming languages and taking the time to understand commands, I found this as the best method to tackle any project or task at hand which accelerated my passion for coding. Yeah, stack overflow does have the solution but I won't understand it if I just copy and paste it. And if it comes to debugging it... Yikes. 

But to go back to the original point, I spent a lot of time coding during my internship and it got me intrested to learn more and expand my knowledge in different branches of programming to see what I enjoy. I started this Journey in March 2021 to learn more about programming specifically in Web Development. My Ethereum & Solidity course also introduced me to ReactJS which I liked to program in and found it cool. Now I'm pursuing with more Java courses to build strong fundmentals and eventually leading into my first goal to understand Front-End Engineering.
